Board of Trustees, December 8, 1903. It is the purpose of the
Station to carry on investigations along various lines of engineering
and to study problems of importance to professional engineers and
to the manufacturing, railway, mining, constructional, and industrial
interests of the State.</p>
</div>

<p>The control of the Engineering Experiment Station is vested in the
heads of the several departments of the College of Engineering. These
constitute the Station Staff and, with the Director, determine the character
of the investigations to be undertaken. The work is carried on
under the supervision of the Staff, sometimes by research fellows as
graduate work, sometimes by members of the instructional staff of the
College of Engineering, but more frequently by investigators belonging
to the Station corps.</p>

<p>The results of these investigations are published in the form of
bulletins, which record mostly the experiments of the Station’s own staff
of investigators. There will also be issued from time to time in the
form of circulars, compilations giving the results of the experiments of
engineers, industrial works, technical institutions, and governmental
testing departments.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="I_Introduction">I. <span class="smcap">Introduction.</span></h2>

<p>Much concern has arisen in late years in the minds of architects
because of the faulty acoustics that exist in many auditoriums. The
prevalence of echoes and reverberations with the consequent difficulty
in hearing and understanding on the part of the auditor defeats the
purpose of the auditorium and diminishes its value.</p>

<p>The Auditorium at the University of Illinois presents such a case.
The building is shaped nearly like a hemisphere, with several large
arches and recesses to break up the regularity of its inner surface. The
original plans of the architect were curtailed because of insufficient
money appropriated for the construction. The interior of the hall, therefore,
was built absolutely plain with almost no breaking up of the large,
smooth wall surfaces; and, at first, there were no furnishings except the
seats and the cocoa matting in the aisles. The acoustical properties
proved to be very unsatisfactory. A reverberation or undue prolongation
of the sound existed, and in addition, because of the large size of
the room and the form and position of the walls, echoes were set up.</p>

<p>If an observer stood on the platform and clapped his hands, a
veritable chaos of sound resulted. Echoes were heard from every direction
and reverberations continued for a number of seconds before all
was still again. Speakers found their utterances thrown back at them,
and auditors all over the house experienced difficulty in understanding
what was said. On one occasion the University band played a piece
which featured a xylophone solo with accompaniment by the other instruments.
It so happened that the leader heard the echo more strongly
than the direct sound and beat time with it. Players near the xylophone
kept time to the direct sound, while those farther away followed the
echo. The confusion may well be imagined.</p>

<p>Thus it seemed that the Auditorium was doomed to be an acoustical
horror; that speakers and singers would avoid it, and that auditors would
attend entertainments in it only under protest. But the apparent misfortune
was in one way a benefit since it provided an opportunity to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
study defective acoustics under exceptionally good conditions and led
to conclusions that not only allowed the Auditorium to be improved but
also indicate some of the pitfalls to be avoided in future construction of
other halls.</p>

<p>An investigation of the acoustical properties of the Auditorium was
begun in 1908 and has continued for six years. It was decided at the
outset not to use “cut and try” methods of cure, but to attack the problem
systematically so that general principles could be found, if possible,
that would apply not only to the case being investigated but to auditoriums
in general. This plan of procedure delayed the solution of the
problem, since it became necessary to study the theory of sound and
carry out laboratory investigations at the same time that the complex
conditions in the Auditorium were being considered. The author spent
one year of the six abroad studying the theory of acoustics and inspecting
various auditoriums.</p>

<p>The main echoes in the Auditorium were located by means of a new
method for tracing the path of sound, the time of reverberation was
determined by Sabine’s method, and a general diagnosis of the acoustical
defects was made. Hangings and curtains were installed in accordance
with the results of the study so that finally the acoustical properties were
improved.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="II_Behavior_of_Sound_Waves_in_a_Room">II. <span class="smcap">Behavior of Sound Waves in a Room.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When a speaker addresses an audience, the sounds he utters
proceed in ever widening spherical waves until they strike the
boundaries of the room. Here the sound is partly reflected, partly transmitted,
and the rest absorbed. The amounts of reflection, absorption
and transmission depend on the character of the walls. A hard, smooth
wall reflects most of the sound so that but little is transmitted or
absorbed. In the case of a porous wall or a yielding wall, the absorption
and transmission are greater, and the reflection is less. After
striking a number of reflecting surfaces, the energy is used up and the
sound dies out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<p>The reflection of sound produces certain advantages and disadvantages
for the acoustics. When it is considered that sound travels about
1100 feet a second it may be seen that a room of ordinary size is almost
immediately filled with sound because of the many reflections. In a
room 40 feet square, for instance, the number of reflections per second
between opposite walls is 1100 ÷ 40, or approximately 27. The number
is really greater than this, since the sound that goes into the
corners is reflected much more frequently than out in the middle
where the distances between walls are greater. The result is that the
sound mixes thoroughly in all parts of the room so as to give the same
average intensity; that is, the sound is of the same average <em>loudness</em>
for all auditors, even for those in the remotest corners.</p>

<p>Though the reflection of sound has the advantage of fulfilling the
conditions for loudness, it introduces at the same time possibilities for
setting up defective acoustics. For instance, when the walls of the room
are hard and smooth very little energy is lost at each impact of the
sound and many reflections take place before it finally dies out. This
slow decadence of the sound, or <em>reverberation</em> as it is called, is the most
common defect in auditoriums.</p>

<p>If a speaker talks in such a hall the auditors have difficulty in
understanding. Each sound, instead of dying out quickly, persists for
some time so that the succeeding words blend with their predecessors
and set up a mixture of sounds which produces confusion. The cure for
the trouble is brought about by the introduction of materials such as
carpets, tapestries, and the like, which act as absorbers of sound and
reduce the time of reverberation.</p>

<p>When music is played in an auditorium with a prolonged reverberation,
the tones following one another blend and produce the same effect
as that of a piano when played with the loud pedal in use. A reverberation
is more advantageous for music than for speech, since the prolongation
and blending of the musical tones is desired, but the mixing
of the words in a speech is a distinct disadvantage. When curing this
defect for halls used for both music and speaking, a middle course must
be steered, so that the reverberation is made somewhat long for speaking
and somewhat short for music, yet fairly satisfactory for both.</p>

<p>Going back to the consideration of the reflection of sound, it is found
that another defect may be produced, namely, an <em>echo</em>. This is the case
when a wall at some distance reflects the sound to the position of the
auditor. He hears the sound first from the speaker, then later by reflection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
from the wall. The time interval between the direct and reflected
sound must be great enough to allow two distinct impressions to be
made. This time is about 1/15 of a second, but varies with the acuteness
of the observer. The farther off the wall is, the greater is the time
interval and the more pronounced is the echo. If the wall is not very
distant, the time interval is too short to allow two distinct impressions
to be made, and the effect on the auditor is then much the same as if
his neighbor at his side speaks the words of the discourse in his ear at
the same time that he gets them directly from the speaker. In case the
reflecting wall is curved so as to focus the sound the echoes are much
more pronounced. A curved wall wherever it may be placed in an auditorium
is thus always a menace to good acoustics.</p>

<p>There are other actions of the sound that may result in acoustical
defects. The phenomena of <em>resonance</em>, for instance, may cause trouble.
Suppose that the waves of sound impinge on an elastic wall, not too
rigid. If these waves are timed right they set the wall in vibration in
the same way that the bell ringer causes a bell to ring by a succession
of properly timed pulls on the bell rope. The wall of the room will then
vibrate under the action of this sound with which it is in tune and will
reinforce it. Now suppose a band is playing in a room. Certain tones
are reinforced, while the others are not affected. The original sound is
then distorted. The action is the same on the voice of the speaker. The
sounds he utters are complex and as they reach the walls certain components
are reinforced and the quality of the sound is changed. This
action of resonance may also be caused by the air in a room. Each
room has a definite pitch to which it responds, the smaller the volume
of the room the higher being the pitch. A large auditorium would
respond to the very low pitch of the bass drum. In small rooms and
alcoves the response is made to higher pitched tones, as may be observed
by singing the different notes of the scale until a resonance is obtained.</p>

<p>Another action of sound causes the <em>interference</em> of waves. Thus
the reflected waves may meet the oncoming ones and set up concentrations
of sound in certain positions and a dearth of sound in others.</p>

<p>Summing up, it is seen that the effects of sound which may exist
in a room are <em>loudness</em>, <em>reverberation</em>, <em>echoes</em>, <em>resonance</em>, and <em>interference</em>,
and that the most common defects are reverberation and echoes. We
now turn to the discussion of the methods of cure.</p>

<h3>A. REVERBERATION AND ITS CURE.</h3>

<p>Everyone has doubtless observed that the hollow reverberations in
an empty house disappear when the house is furnished. So, in an
auditorium, the reverberation is lessened when curtains, tapestries, and
the like are installed in sufficient numbers. The reason for this action
is found when we inquire what ultimately becomes of the sound.</p>

<p>Sound is a form of energy and energy can not be destroyed. When
it finally dies out, the sound must be changed to some other form of
energy. In the case of the walls of a room, for instance, it has been
shown in a preceding paragraph that the sound may be changed into
mechanical energy in setting these walls in vibration. Again, some of
the sound may pass out through open windows and thus disappear. The
rest of the sound, according to Lord Rayleigh, is transformed by friction
into heat. Thus<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> a high pitched sound, such as a hiss, before it travels
any great distance is killed out by the friction of the air. Lower pitched
sounds, on reaching a wall, set up a friction in the process of reflection
between the air particles and the wall so that some of the energy is converted
into heat.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> The amount of sound energy thus lost is small if the
walls are hard and smooth. The case is much different, however, if the
walls are rough and porous, since it appears that the friction in the
pores dissipates the sound energy into heat. In this connection, Lamb<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
writes: “In a sufficiently narrow tube the waves are rapidly stifled, the
mechanical energy lost being of course converted into heat. *&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*
When a sound wave impinges on a slab which is permeated by a large
number of very minute channels, part of the energy is lost, so far as
the sound is concerned, by dissipation within these channels in the way
just explained. The interstices in hangings and carpets act in a similar
manner, and it is to this cause that the effect of such appliances in
deadening echoes in a room is to be ascribed, a certain proportion of the
energy being lost at each reflection. It is to be observed that it is only
through the action of true dissipative forces, such as viscosity and thermal
conduction, that sound can die out in an enclosed space, no mere modifications
of the waves by irregularities being of any avail.”</p>

<p>It should be pointed out in this connection that any mechanical
breaking up of the sound by relief work on the walls or by obstacles in
the room will not primarily diminish the energy of the sound. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
may break up the regular reflection and eliminate echoes, but the sound
energy as such disappears only when friction is set up.</p>

<p>The following quotation from Rayleigh<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> emphasizes these conclusions:
“In large spaces, bounded by non-porous walls, roof, and floor,
and with few windows, a prolonged resonance seems inevitable. The
mitigating influence of thick carpets in such cases is well known. The
application of similar material to the walls and roof appears to offer the
best chance of further improvement.”</p>

<p><i>Experimental Work on Cure of Reverberation.</i>—The most important
experimental work in applying this principle of the absorbing power
of carpets, curtains, etc., has been done by Professor Wallace C. Sabine
of Harvard University.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> In a set of interesting experiments lasting
over a period of four years, he was able to deduce a general relation
between <i>t</i>, the time of reverberation, <i>V</i>, the volume of the room, and <i>a</i>,
the absorbing power of the different materials present. Thus:</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="in4"><i>t</i> = 0.164 <i>V</i> ÷ <i>a</i></span> <span class="in4 fright">(1)</span>
</p>

<p>For good acoustical conditions, that is, for a short time of reverberation,
the volume <i>V</i> should be small and the absorbing materials, represented
by <i>a</i>, large. This is the case in a small room with plenty of
curtains and rugs and furniture. If, however, the volume of the room
is great, as in the case of an auditorium, and the amount of absorbing
materials small, a troublesome reverberation will result.</p>

<p>Professor Sabine determined the absorbing powers of a number of
different materials. Calling an open window a perfect absorber of sound,
the results obtained may be written approximately as follows:</p>

<table class="p1 b1" id="t9">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">One square meter of open window space</td>
  <td class="tdr">1.000  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">One square meter of glass, plaster, or brick</td>
  <td class="tdr">.025  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">One square meter of heavy rugs, curtains, etc.</td>
  <td class="tdr">.25  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">One square meter of hair felt, 1 inch thick</td>
  <td class="tdr">.75  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">One square meter of audience</td>
  <td class="tdr">.96  </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>These values, together with the formula, allow a calculation to be
made in advance of construction for the time of reverberation. This
pioneer work cleared the subject of architectural acoustics from the fog
of mystery that hung over it and allowed the essential principles to be
seen in the light of scientific experiment.</p>

<p>In a later investigation<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> Sabine showed that the reverberation depended
also on the pitch of sound. As a concrete example, the high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
notes of a violin might be less reverberant with a large audience than
the lower tones of the bass viol, although both might have the same
reverberation in the room with no audience. Again, the voice of a man
with notes of low pitch might give satisfactory results in an auditorium
while the voice of a woman with higher pitched notes would be unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>These considerations show that the acoustics in an auditorium vary
with other factors than the volume of the room and the amount of
absorbing material present. The audience may be large or small, the
speaker’s voice high or low, the entertainment a musical number or an
address. The best arrangement for good acoustics is then a compromise
where the average conditions are satisfied. The solution offered by
Professor Sabine is such an average one, and has proved satisfactory in
practice.</p>

<p>The problem of architectural acoustics has been attacked experimentally
by other workers. Stewart<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> proposed a cure for the poor
acoustical conditions in the Sibley Auditorium at Cornell University.
His experiments confirmed the work of Sabine. Marage<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>, after investigating
the properties of six halls in Paris, approved Sabine’s results and
advocated a time of reverberation of from ½ to 1 second for the case of
speech.</p>

<p><i>Formulae for Reverberation of Sound in a Room.</i>—On the theoretical
side, Sabine’s formula has been developed by Franklin,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> who
obtained the relation <i>t</i> = 0.1625 <i>V</i> ÷ <i>a</i>, an interesting confirmation,
since Sabine’s experimental value for the constant was 0.164.</p>

<p>A later development has been given by Jäger,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> who assumes for a
room whose dimensions are not greater than about 60 feet, that the
sound, after filling the room, passes equally in all directions through
any point, and that the average energy is the same in different parts of
the room. By using the theory of probability and considering that a
beam of sound in any direction may be likened to a particle with a
definite velocity, he was able to deduce Sabine’s formula and write down
the factors that enter into the constants. Applying his results to the
case of reflection of sound from a wall, he showed that sound would be
reflected in greater volume when the mass of the wall was increased and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
the pitch of the sound made higher. He showed also that when sound
impinges on a porous wall, more energy is absorbed when the pitch of
the sound is high than when it is low, since the vibrations of the air
are more frequent, and more friction is introduced in the interstices
of the material.</p>

<h3>B. ECHOES AND THEIR REMEDY.</h3>

<p>An echo is set up by a reflecting wall. If an observer stands some
distance from the front of a cliff and claps his hands, or shouts, he
finds that the sound is returned to him from the cliff as an echo.
So, in an auditorium, an auditor near the speaker gets the sound first
directly from the speaker, then, an instant later, a strong repetition of
the sound by reflection from a distant wall. This echo is more pronounced
if the wall is curved and the auditor is at the point where the
sound is focused.</p>

<p>To cure such an echo, two methods may be considered. One method
consists in changing the form of the wall so that the reflected sound no
longer sets up the echo. That is, either change the angle of the wall,
so that the reflected sound is sent in a new direction where it may be
absorbed or where it may reinforce the direct sound without producing
any echoes, or else modify the surface of the wall by relief work or by
panels of absorbing material, so that the strong reflected wave is broken
up and the sound is scattered. The second method is to make the
reflecting wall a “perfect” absorber, so that the incident sound is swallowed
up and little or none reflected. These methods have been designated
as “surgical” and “medicinal” respectively. Each method has its
disadvantages. Changing the form of the walls in an auditorium is
likely to do violence to the architectural design. On the other hand, there
are no perfect absorbers, except open windows, and these can seldom be
applied. The cure in each case is, then, a matter of study of the special
conditions of the auditorium. Usually a combination of the surgical and
the medicinal cures is adopted. For instance, coffering a wall so that
panels of absorbing material may be introduced has been found to work
well in bettering the acoustics, and also, in many cases, it fits in with
the architectural features.</p>

<h3>C. POPULAR CONCEPTION OF CURES.—USE OF WIRES AND SOUNDING
BOARDS.</h3>

<p>A few words should be written concerning the popular notion that
wires and sounding boards are effective in curing faulty acoustics.
Experiments and observations show that wires are of practically no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
benefit, and sounding boards can be used only in special cases. Wires
stretched in a room scarcely affect the sound, since they present too small
a surface to disturb the waves. They have much the same effect on
sound waves that a fish line in the water has on water waves. The idea
has, perhaps, grown into prominence because of the action of a piano
in responding to the notes of a singer. The piano has every advantage
over a wire in an auditorium. It has a large number of strings tuned
to different pitches so that it responds to any note sung. It also has a
sounding board that reinforces strongly the sound of the strings. Finally,
the singer is usually near the piano. The wire in the auditorium responds
to only one tone of the many likely to be present, it has no sounding
board, and the singer is some distance away. But little effect, therefore,
is to be expected.</p>

<p>The author has visited a number of halls where wires have been
installed, and has yet to find a case where pronounced improvement has
resulted.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> Sabine<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> cites a case where five miles of wire were stretched
in a hall without helping the acoustical conditions. It is curious that
so erroneous a conception has grown up in the public mind with so little
experimental basis to support it.</p>

<p><i>Sounding Boards.</i>—Sounding boards or, more properly, reflecting
boards, have value in special cases. Some experiments are described
later where pronounced effects were obtained. The sounding board
should be of special design to fit the conditions under which it is to
be used.</p>

<p><i>Modeling New Auditoriums after Old Ones with Good Acoustics.</i>—Another
suggestion often made is for architects to model auditoriums
after those already built that have good acoustical properties. It does
not follow that halls so modeled will be successful, since the materials
used in construction are not the same year after year. For instance,
a few years ago it was the usual custom to put lime plaster on wooden
lath; now it is frequently the practice to put gypsum plaster on metal
lath, which forms an entirely different kind of a surface. This latter
arrangement makes hard, non-porous walls which absorb but little
sound, and thus aggravate the reverberation. Further, a new hall
usually is changed somewhat in form from the old one, to suit the
ideas of the architect, and it is very likely that the changes will affect
the acoustics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<h3>D. THE EFFECT OF THE VENTILATION SYSTEM ON THE ACOUSTICS.</h3>

<p>At first thought it might seem that the ventilation system in a room
would affect the acoustical properties. The air is the medium that
transmits the sound. It has been shown that the wind has an action in
changing the direction of propagation of sound.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> Sound is also reflected
and refracted at the boundary of gases that differ in density and temperature.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
It is found, however, that the effect of the usual ventilation
currents on the acoustics in an auditorium is small. The temperature
difference between the heated current and the air in the room is not
great enough to affect the sound appreciably, and the motion of the
current is too slow and over too short a distance to change the action
of the sound to any marked extent.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>Under special circumstances, the heating and ventilating systems
may prove disadvantageous.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> A hot stove or a current of hot air in the
center of the room will seriously disturb the action of sound. Any
irregularity in the air currents so that sheets of cold and heated air
fluctuate about the room will also modify the regular action of the sound
and produce confusion. The object to be striven for is to keep the air
in the room as homogeneous and steady as possible. Hot stoves, radiators,
and currents of heated air should be kept near the walls and out
of the center of the room. It is of some small advantage to have the
ventilation current go in the same direction that the sound is to go,
since a wind tends to carry the sound with it.</p>

</div>

<h3>A. PRELIMINARY WORK.</h3>

<p>As already stated, a chaos of sound was set up when an observer
in the Auditorium spoke or shouted or clapped his hands. Both echoes
and reverberations were present and could be heard in all parts of the
room, though the echoes seemed to be strongest on the stage and in the
balcony. The prospects for bettering the acoustics were not very
encouraging. Luckily, the cure for the reverberation was fairly simple,
since Sabine’s method gave a definite procedure that could be applied
to this case. The cure for the echo, however, was yet to be found. It
was first necessary to find out which walls set up the defect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>The attempt to locate echoes by generating a sound and listening
with the ear met with only partial success. The ear is sensitive enough
but becomes confused when many echoes are present, coming apparently
from every direction, so that the evidence thus obtained is not altogether
conclusive. It became apparent that the successful solution lay in fixing
the attention on the sound going in a particular direction and finding
out where it went after reflection; then tracing out the path in another
particular direction, and so on until the evidence obtained gave some
hint of the general action of the sound.</p>

<figure id="Fig_4" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 12em;">
  <img src="images/i_016.png" width="731" height="1239" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4. Watch as Source of Sound, Backed by a Concave Reflector.</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>The first step in the application of this principle was to use a
faint sound which could not be heard at any great distance unless
reinforced in some way. The ticks of a watch were directed, by means
of a reflector (<a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>) to certain walls suspected of giving echoes. Using
the relation that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection,
the reflected sound was readily located, and the watch ticks heard distinctly
after they had traveled a total distance as great as 70 to 80 feet
from the source.</p>

<p>In a later experiment, a metronome was used which gave a louder
sound. It was enclosed in a sound-proof structure (<a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a>) with only
one opening, so that the sound could be directed by means of a horn.
This method was suggested by the work of Gustav Lyon in the Hall of
the Trocadero at Paris,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> where a somewhat similar arrangement was
used. The method was successful and verified the observations taken
previously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<figure id="Fig_5" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 32em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6. Arc-light as Source of Sound.</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>Though the results obtained with the watch and metronome seemed
conclusive, yet the observer was not always confident of the results.
A further method was sought, and a more satisfactory one found
by using an alternating current arc-light at the focus of a parabolic
reflector (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>). In addition to the light, the arc gave forth a
hissing sound, which was of short wave length and therefore experienced
but little diffraction. The bundle of light rays was, therefore, accompanied
by a bundle of sound, both coming from the same source and
subject to the same law of reflection. The path of the sound was easily
found by noting the position of the spot of light on the wall. The reflected
sound was located by applying the relation that the angles of
incidence and reflection are equal. The arc-light sound was intense and
gave the observer confidence in results that was lacking in the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
methods. To trace successive reflections, small mirrors were fastened
to the reflecting walls so that the path of the reflected sound was indicated
by the reflected light. A “diagnosis” of the acoustical troubles of
the Auditorium was then made by this method.</p>

<p>It should be noted here that the arc-light sound is not the same
as the sounds of music or speech, these latter ones being of lower pitch
and of longer wave length. It was, therefore, a matter of doubt whether
the results obtained would hold also for the case of speech or music.
Tests made by observers stationed in the Auditorium when musical
numbers and speeches were rendered, however, verified the general conclusions
obtained with the arc-light.</p>

<p>It should be pointed out in this connection that there is an objection
to applying the “ray” method of geometrical optics to the case of sound.
It is much more difficult to get a ray of sound than it is to get a ray of
light.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> This is due to the difference in the wave lengths in the two
cases. It appears that the waves are diffracted, or spread out, in proportion
to their length, the longer waves being spread out to a greater
extent. The short waves of light from the sun, for instance, as they
come through a window mark out a sharp pattern on the floor, which
shows that the waves proceed in straight lines with but little diffraction
or spreading. Far different is it with the longer waves of sound. If
the window is open, we are able to hear practically all the sounds from
outdoors, even that of a wagon around the corner, although we may be
at the other end of the room away from the window. The longer sound
waves spread out and bend at right angles around corners, so that it is
almost impossible to get a sound shadow with them. Furthermore, in
the matter of reflection, it appears that the area of the reflecting wall
must be comparable with the length of the waves being reflected. In
the case of light, the waves are very minute, hence a mirror can be very
small and yet be able to set up a reflection; but sound waves are of greater
length, the average wave length of speech (45 cm.) being about 700 000
times longer than the wave length of yellow light (.00006 cm.), hence
the reflecting surface must be correspondingly larger. An illustration
will perhaps make this clearer. Suppose a post one foot square projects
through a water surface. The small ripples on the water will be reflected
easily from the post, but the large water waves pass by almost as if the
post were not there. The reflecting surface must have an area comparable
with the size of the wave if it is to cause an effective reflection.
Relief work in auditoriums, if of small dimensions, will affect only the
high pitched sounds, i.&#160;e., those of short wave length, while the low<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
pitched sounds of long wave length are reflected much the same as from
a rather rough wall. It is also shown that the area of the reflecting
surface is dependent on its distance from the source of sound and from
the observer; the greater these distances are the larger must be the
reflecting surface.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>These considerations all show that the reflection of sound is a
complicated matter. The dimensions of a wall to reflect sound, or of
relief work to scatter it, are determined by the wave length and by the
various other factors mentioned. It should be said with caution that a
“ray” of sound is reflected in a definite way from a small bit of relief
work. We must deal with <em>bundles</em> of sound, not too sharply bounded,
and have them strike surfaces of considerable area in order to produce
reflections with any completeness.</p>

<h3>B. DETAILS OF THE ACOUSTICAL SURVEY IN THE AUDITORIUM.</h3>

<p>The general effect of the walls of the Auditorium on the sound may
be anticipated by considering analogous cases in geometrical optics, but
with the restrictions on “rays” described in the preceding paragraph.
The sound does not actually confine itself to the sharp boundaries shown.
The diagrams are intended to indicate the main effect of the sound in
the region so bounded. <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a> gives such an idea for the concentration
of sound in the longitudinal section of the Auditorium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>The plan followed in the experimental work was to anticipate the
path of the sound as indicated in <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>, then to verify the results with
the arc-light reflector. <a href="#Fig_8">Figs. 8</a> and <a href="#Fig_9">9</a> show the effect of the rear wall
in the balcony in forming echoes on the stage. The speaker was particularly
unfortunate, being afflicted with no less than ten echoes.</p>

<p>The hard, smooth, circular wall bounding the main floor under the

reverse direction of the arrows.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12. This Figure Taken with <a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a> Shows How an Echo is Set Up on
the Stage.</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>A more comprehensive idea of the action of this wall is shown in
<a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>. This reflected sound was small in amount and therefore not
a serious disadvantage.</p>

<p>The cases cited were fairly easy to determine since the bundles of
sound considered were confined closely to either a vertical or a horizontal
plane for which the plans of the building gave some idea of the
probable path of the sound. For other planes, the paths followed could
be anticipated by analogy from the results already found. <a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a> shows
in perspective the development of the result expressed in <a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>.</p>

<p>A square bundle of sound starts from the stage and strikes the
spherical surface of the dome. After reflection, it is brought to a point
focus, as shown, and spreads out until it strikes the vertical cylindrical
wall in the rear of the balcony. This wall reflects it to a line focus,
after which it proceeds to the stage. Auditors on all parts of the stage
complained of hearing echoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>Referring to <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>, it is seen that the arch over the stage reflects
sound back to the stage. <a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a> shows in perspective the focusing
action of this overhead arch. <a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a> shows the effect of the second arch.
Some of this sound is reflected to the stage and to the seats in front of
the stage; other portions, striking more nearly horizontally, are reflected
to the side balconies. The echoes are not strong except for high pitched
notes with short wave lengths, since the width of the arch is small.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15. Transverse Section Showing how Most Pronounced Echoes Are
Set Up by the Two Concave Surfaces.</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>Passing now to the transverse section, <a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>, we find the most
pronounced echoes in the Auditorium. If an observer generates a sound
in the middle of the room directly under the center of the skylight,
distinct echoes are set up. A bundle of sound passes to the concave surface
which converges the sound to a focus, after which it spreads out
again to the other concave surface and is again converged to a focus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
nearly at the starting point. The distance traveled is about 225 feet,
taking about ¼ second, so that the conditions are right for setting up
a strong echo. This echo is duplicated by the sound which goes in the
reverse of the path just described. Another echo, somewhat less strong,
is formed by the sound that goes to the dome overhead and which is
reflected almost straight back, since the observer is nearly at the center
of the sphere of which the dome is a part. These echoes repeat themselves,
for the sound does not stop on reaching the starting point but
is reflected from the floor and repeats the action just described. As
many as ten distinct echoes have been generated by a single impulse
of sound.</p>

<p>The echo shown in <a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a> is repeated in a somewhat modified form
for a sound generated on the stage by a speaker. <a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a> shows the
path taken by the sound. This echo is duplicated by the sound that

both sides. <a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a> is a perspective showing the path. The sound does
not confine itself closely to a geometrical pattern, as shown in the picture,
but spreads out by diffraction. The main effect is shown by the figure.</p>

<p>Thus far only the echoes that reached the stage have been described.
Other echoes were found in other parts of the hall, and it seemed that
few places were free from them. The side walls in the balcony, for
instance, were instrumental in causing strong echoes in the rear of the
balcony. <a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a> shows in perspective the action of one of these walls.
These two surfaces were similar in shape and symmetrically placed.
Each was the upper portion of a concave surface with its center of
curvature in the center of the building under the dome. The general
effect of the left hand wall was to concentrate the sound falling on it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
in the right hand seats in the balcony. Some of the sound struck the
opposite wall and was reflected to the stage, as shown in <a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>.
Auditors who sought the furthermost rear seats in the balcony to escape
echoes were thus caught by this unexpected action of the sound. The
right hand wall acted in a similar way to send the sound to the upper
left balcony.</p>

<figure id="Fig_18" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 32em;">
  <img src="images/i_027.jpg" width="2018" height="2014" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18. Perspective Showing Sound Reflected from Concave Wall in
Balcony. Diffraction Not Considered.</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>The dome surface concentrates most of its sound near the front
of the central portion of the balcony and the ground floor in front of
the balcony in the form of a caustic cone. <a href="#Fig_7">Figs. 7</a>, <a href="#Fig_9">9</a> and <a href="#Fig_11">11</a> give some
conception of how a concentration of sound is caused by this spherical
surface. The echo in the front portion of the balcony was especially
distinct. On one occasion, in this place, the author was able to hear the
speaker more clearly from the echo than by listening to the direct sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p>Minor echoes were set up by the horizontal arch surfaces in the
balcony. The sound from the stage was concentrated by reflection from
these surfaces and then passed to a second reflection from the concave
surfaces back of them. Auditors in the side balcony were thus disagreeably
startled by having sound come from overhead from the rear.</p>

<h3>C. CONCLUSION DRAWN FROM THE ACOUSTICAL SURVEY.</h3>

<p>The results of the survey show that curved walls are largely responsible
for the formation of echoes because they concentrate the reflected
sound. It seems desirable, therefore, to emphasize the danger of using
such walls unless their action is annulled by absorbing materials or relief
work. Large halls with curved walls are almost sure to have acoustical
defects.</p>

<h3>D. METHODS EMPLOYED TO IMPROVE THE ACOUSTICS.</h3>

<p><i>Reflecting Boards.</i>—The provisional cure was brought about gradually
by trying different devices suggested by the diagnosis. In one set
of experiments sounding boards of various shapes and sizes were used.
A flat board about five feet square placed at an incline over the position
of the speaker produced little effect. A larger canvas surface, about
12 by 20 feet, was not much better. A parabolic reflector, however,
gave a pronounced effect. This reflector was mounted over a pulpit at
one end of the stage and served to intercept much of the sound that
otherwise would have gone to the dome and produced echoes. The
path of the reflected sound was parallel to the axis of the paraboloid of
which the reflector was a quarter section. There was no difficulty in
tracing out the reflected sound. Auditors in the path of the reflected
rays reported an echo, but auditors in other parts of the Auditorium
were remarkably free from the usual troubles. The device was not used
permanently, since many speakers objected to the raised platform. Moreover,
it was not a complete cure, since it was not suited for band concerts
and other events, where the entire stage was used. Another reflector
similar in shape to the one just described is shown in <a href="#Fig_21">Figs. 21</a> and <a href="#Fig_22">22</a>.</p>

<p><i>Sabine’s Method.</i>—The time of reverberation was determined by
Sabine’s method. An organ pipe making approximately 526 vibrations
a second was blown for about three seconds and then stopped. An
auditor listened to the decreasing sound, and when it died out made
a record electrically on a chronograph drum. The time of reverberation
was found to be 5.90 seconds, this being the mean of 19 sets of measurements,
each of about 20 observations. The reverberation was found also
by calculation from Sabine’s equation (see <a href="#III_Methods_of_Improving_Faulty_Acoustics">Section III</a>), taking the
volume of the Auditorium as 11,800 cubic meters and calculating the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
absorbing power of all the surfaces in the room. This calculation gave
6.4 seconds. The agreement between the two results is as close as
could be expected, since neither the intensity of the sound nor the
pitch used by the author was the same as those used by Professor Sabine,
and both of these factors affect the time of reverberation.</p>

<figure id="Fig_21" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img src="images/i_030.png" width="1765" height="1107" alt=" ">

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22. Photograph of Parabolic Reflector.</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>Several years later the time of reverberation was again determined
after certain changes had been made. A thick carpet had been placed
on the stage, heavy velour curtains 18 by 32 feet in area hung on the
wall at the rear of the stage, a large canvas painting 400 square feet in
area was installed, and the glass removed from the skylight in the ceiling.
The time of reverberation was reduced to 4.8 seconds. With an audience
present this value was reduced still more, and when the hall was
crowded at commencement time the reverberation was not troublesome.</p>

<p><i>Method of Eliminating Echoes.</i>—Although the time of reverberation
was reduced to be fairly satisfactory, as just explained, the echoes still
persisted, and were very annoying. Attempts were made to reduce
individual echoes by hanging cotton flannel on the walls at critical
points. Thus the shaded areas in <a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a> were covered and also the
entire rear wall in the balcony. Pronounced echoes still remained, and
it was evident that some drastic action was necessary to alleviate this
condition. Four large canvases, shown in <a href="#Fig_23">Figs. 23</a> and <a href="#Fig_24">24</a>, were then
hung in the dome in position suggested by the results of the diagnosis.
A very decided improvement followed. For the first time the echoes
were reduced to a marked degree and speakers on the stage could talk
without the usual annoyance. This arrangement eliminated the echoes
not only on the stage, but generally all over the house. A number of
minor echoes were still left, but the conditions were much improved,
especially when a large audience was present to reduce the reverberation.</p>

<p><i>Proposed Final Cure.</i>—The state of affairs just described is the
condition at the time of writing. Two propositions were considered in
planning the final cure. One proposition involved a complete remodeling
of the interior of the Auditorium. Plans of an interior were drawn in
accordance with the results of the experimental work that would probably
give satisfactory acoustics. This proposition was not carried out because
of the expense and because it was thought desirable to attempt a cure
without changing the shape of the room. The latter plan is the one
now being followed. It is proposed to replace the present unsightly
curtains with materials which will conform to the architectural features
of the Auditorium and which will have a pleasing color scheme. At
the same time, it will be necessary to hold to the features which have
improved the acoustics.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
